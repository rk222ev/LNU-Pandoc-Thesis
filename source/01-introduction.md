# Introduction

In this chapter[@chris.beams.io, p. 38] you shall give an introduction to your thesis project.
It shall start with a broad overview of what your project is all about. Similar to the
abstract, the introduction shall make the reader interested in continue reading your report. Don’t be too detailed here; there are plenty of opportunities to add details in later chapters.

## Background

After you have described your project, you shall continue with writing a background to the area your project is in. Here you describe theories necessary to understand your project and explain terms you will use in the report.
Example: if you do a project that is about evaluating software architectures, you de- scribe what a software architecture is, why it is important to design an architecture that suits a specific software system, methods for evaluating and comparing different architec- tures, etc.

## Previous research

Here you briefly describe what others have done in the field or how others have attempted to explain or solve the same or similar problem as you are investigating. It is okay to refer to tech articles and online blogs and portals, but you must also refer to published articles in the field. To find related articles, use the University library search tool OneSearch [^1] or Google Scholar [^2].

##  Problem formulation

Here you give a detailed description of the research problem you intend to investigate. You can re-use the problem formulation from your project plan.

## Motivation

Here you motivate why your research problem is interesting for science, society or indus- try. You can re-use the motivation part from your project plan.

## Research Question

Your research problem is broken down into one or more research questions (RQ). RQs state exactly 
what you want to investigate in your thesis project. You have already defined research questions 
in your project plan. Copy and paste them here.
You are also required to make statements about tentative and expected answers to your research questions (called propositions). What do you think your project will result in?
Don’t mention anything about research method here. It will be covered in the next chapter.

|-----|-------------------------|
| RQ1 | Research question 1 ... |
| RQ2 | Research question 2 ... |

  Note that the research questions you have defined in the project plan can change slightly during the course of the project. This is not a problem. It is often difficult to foresee everything that can occur when writing the project plan.

## Scope/Limitation

You cannot solve everything. Here you describe what you do, and what you don’t do, in your project. Limitations can for example be that you only compare some frameworks of all frameworks available on the market, that you only suggest an architecture for a spe- cific software product and not a general architecture, or that you only include university students in a study and not a broader population sample.

## Target group
Here you outline which target group that might be interested in your thesis. If you, for example, do a project about software architectures, a target group can be professional developers and architects that work with similar software systems as the system you in- vestigated.

## Outline

Here you outline the rest of the report. It shall contain which chapters that will follow, and what each of them is about.
