# Results

In this chapter you show and describe your results. You shall only show the raw results without any analysis, and you shall not put any conclusions or opinions in the description of the results. Try to be as objective as possible. An example of results from an experi- ment comparing five sorting algorithms is shown in Table 4.1 below.

What you show heavily depends on the type of research and what type of data you collect. Numerical data can for example be shown in both tables and graphs. A comple- mentary graph for the sorting algorithms example is shown in Figure 4.1. For a question- naire you can show the frequency (how many participants that selected the same answer) of each possible answer to a question.

Note that Tables and Figures shall be labeled with chapter.number, for example Table 4.1 and Figure 1.6.
