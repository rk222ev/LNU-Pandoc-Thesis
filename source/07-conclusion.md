# Conclusion

In this chapter you end your report with a conclusion of your findings. What have you shown in your project? Are your results relevant for science, industry or society? How general are your results (i.e. can they be applied to other areas/problems as well)? Also discuss if anything in your project could have been done differently to possibly get better results.
This chapter is also written in present tense.
