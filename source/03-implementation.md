# Implementation

It is common that you will develop something in your project. It can be a mobile app, a stand-alone application, a website, a game, etc. In this chapter you describe the software you have implemented.
In some projects you donâ€™t develop anything, for example if you do a systematic literature review. In this case you remove this chapter.
