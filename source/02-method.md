# Method

In this chapter you shall describe the scientific approach that will be used to answer your research problem.

## Scientific approach

Here you define which formal research method(s) that shall be used to answer your re- search question(s). Research methods are divided into quantitative and qualitative meth- ods. Quantitative methods result in numerical data, and qualitative in non-numerical data.
Examples of quantitative methods you can use are:

- Experiment, where you modify a variable (for example which algorithm to use for solving a problem) and measure its effects on another variable (for example exe- cution time or memory usage). The variable you modify is called the independent variable and the variable you measure is called the dependent variable.

- Survey, where you typically use a questionnaire to get people’s opinions about something. In quantitative surveys the questions must have numerical answers. You can for example use a Likert scale: 1 - Strongly Disagree, 2 - Disagree, 3 - Neither Agree nor Disagree, 4 - Agree, 5 - Strongly Agree.

Examples of qualitative methods you can use are:

- Survey. Same as the quantitative survey, but the questions have free text or multiple- choice answers.

- Case Study, where you do a detailed examination of a specific case. Examples of cases are usability tests of a piece of software or how to handle a security breach in an IT system.
j
- Interview. A survey and an interview have the same goal: to get people’s opinions about something. The difference is that an interview is much more detailed, and is only conducted with one or a few participants whereas a survey can reach a large number of participants.

Another method that does not fit into any of the two categories is systematic liter- ature review. Here the researcher collects data from published research made by other researchers and summarizes and synthesizes it to give an overview of the subject area.

There are other research methods not mentioned here, but this list covers the most common ones for thesis projects in computer science. A more detailed description of the methods can be found in the Thesis Guide at the Course room for Degree projects [1].

## Method description

When you have defined which research method(s) that will be used to answer your re- search question(s), you shall continue by describing how the research methods will be applied in your project. If you for example shall conduct an experiment you describe your independent and dependent variables, how many times the experiment will be repeated, which software tools that will be used to run the experiment, etc. If you for example shall conduct a survey you describe how participants will be selected, how the questionnaire will be designed, how it shall be distributed to the participants, how data will be analyzed, etc.

## Reliability and Validity

Here you discuss the reliability and validity of your project.
Reliability means how accurate and consistent your results are. The results from an
experiment can often differ from different runs. If you for example measure the execution time for a sorting algorithm on a random set of integers, it will be slightly different from run to run due to the randomized input set. To deal with this experiments are usually repeated several times, and an average result is calculated. Discuss how you deal with reliability problems in your project here.
Validity threats are anything that can affect your results and that you cannot control. A common validity threat in studies has to do with sampling: is the participants you have selected for the study representative for the population as a whole? Discuss if you have any validity threats in your project here.
You can read more about reliability and validity in the Thesis Guide at the Course room for Degree projects [1].

## Ethical considerations
You are required to discuss any ethical considerations (if any) in your project. If you do an experiment you will most likely not have any ethical considerations, but in a survey ethical considerations can for example be how you make sure that the privacy of the people participating in the study is not violated (by for example removing names from the gathered data).
