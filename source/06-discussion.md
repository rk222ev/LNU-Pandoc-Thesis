# Discussion

Here you discuss your findings and if your research question(s) have been answered. Think of research as a feedback loop. You define a problem, find a method of approaching it, execute the research and gather data. The data is then used to answer your research problem, thus creating the loop.
You shall also discuss how your findings relate to what other researchers have done in the area. Are your results similar to the findings in the related research you described in the Previous Research section?
This chapter is typically written in the present tense, while the previous chapters typ- ically are written in past tense.
